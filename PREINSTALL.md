# FireMongo Bridge Extension - Pre-Installation Guide

## ðŸ’° Pricing Information

**Extension Cost: $8/month**

### What's Included
- Real-time Firestore to MongoDB synchronization
- Batch processing for existing documents
- Data transformation for Firestore-specific types
- Management APIs for monitoring and control
- Automatic index creation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Connection pooling and performance optimization

### Additional Costs
- **Cloud Functions**: Pay per invocation (~$0.40/million invocations)
- **Firestore**: Standard read/write costs (~$0.06/100K reads, ~$0.18/100K writes)
- **MongoDB**: Your MongoDB provider costs (Atlas, self-hosted, etc.)

### Cost Estimation Example
For a typical application with:
- 10,000 documents
- 1,000 daily updates
- 100 daily reads

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
- Extension License: $8.00
- Cloud Functions: ~$0.12
- Firestore Operations: ~$0.05
- **Total: ~$8.17/month**

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

### Required Setup
1. **Firebase Project**: Must have billing enabled
2. **MongoDB Database**: Atlas cluster or self-hosted MongoDB
3. **Firebase CLI**: For local development and testing
4. **Node.js 20+**: For development environment

### MongoDB Requirements
- MongoDB 4.4+ (recommended: 6.0+)
- Network access from Google Cloud Functions
- User with read/write permissions
- Sufficient storage for your data

### Firebase Requirements
- Blaze (pay-as-you-go) billing plan
- Firestore database enabled
- Cloud Functions API enabled
- Appropriate IAM permissions

## ðŸ”§ What You Need Before Installing

### 1. MongoDB Connection String
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
```
- Username and password for MongoDB access
- Cluster hostname and port
- Database name
- Connection options (if needed)

### 2. Collection Planning
Decide on your collection mapping strategy:
```json
{
  "users": "firestore_users",
  "products": "firestore_products",
  "orders": "firestore_orders"
}
```

### 3. Sync Strategy
Choose your synchronization mode:
- **Real-time**: Immediate sync for all changes
- **Batch**: Manual sync only (for compliance or cost control)

### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Document Size**: Large documents may require smaller batch sizes
- **Collection Count**: More collections = more function invocations
- **Update Frequency**: High-frequency updates increase costs
- **Data Volume**: Consider MongoDB storage and performance

## ðŸš€ Common Use Cases

### 1. Analytics and Reporting
- Sync Firestore data to MongoDB for complex analytics
- Use MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- Integrate with BI tools

### 2. Backup and Compliance
- Create MongoDB backups of Firestore data
- Meet regulatory requirements
- Disaster recovery planning

### 3. Multi-Database Architecture
- Use Firestore for real-time features
- Use MongoDB for complex queries
- Hybrid application architecture

### 4. Data Migration
- Migrate from Firestore to MongoDB
- Gradual transition strategy
- A/B testing with both databases

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### MongoDB Security
- Use MongoDB Atlas for managed security
- Enable network access lists
- Use strong authentication
- Consider encryption at rest

### Firebase Security
- MongoDB credentials stored as secrets
- No sensitive data in logs
- CORS configured for management APIs
- Input validation on all parameters

### Network Security
- MongoDB must be accessible from Google Cloud
- Consider VPC peering for private networks
- Use SSL/TLS for all connections

## ðŸ“Š Performance Guidelines

### Recommended Settings
- **Batch Size**: 100-500 documents (adjust based on document size)
- **Memory**: 512MB for real-time sync, 1GB for batch processing
- **Timeout**: 540 seconds for large collections
- **Concurrency**: 1000 for real-time sync

### Optimization Tips
1. **Indexes**: Enable for better query performance
2. **Collection Mapping**: Use to organize data efficiently
3. **Batch Processing**: Use for large initial syncs
4. **Monitoring**: Watch function logs for performance issues

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Data Consistency
- Real-time sync provides eventual consistency
- Small delays possible during high load
- Use management API to verify sync status

### Error Handling
- Failed operations are logged with details
- Automatic retry for transient errors
- Manual recovery options available

### Monitoring
- Function logs available in Firebase Console
- Sync status API for monitoring
- Performance metrics in Cloud Functions

### Limitations
- Maximum document size: 1MB (MongoDB limit)
- Maximum batch size: 1000 documents
- Function timeout: 540 seconds
- Memory limit: 1GB per function
